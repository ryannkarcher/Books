               In this dark, psychological thriller, farmer Dexter McCray becomes both a detective and a suspect. He is a man fighting to escape a troubled past, but after waking from an alcoholic blackout to discover his tractor stuck in a ditch and the body of a teenage girl in the cottonwood grove bordering his cornfield, he wonders if it's a fight he cannot win. In the hopes of proving his innocence, he sets out to find the truth. Now, isolated from friends and family and devoid of an alibi, he turns to the only person left who can help pick up the pieces of his shattered life...the dead girl herself. Rector understands the complexities of a haunting tale and a compelling who-done-it, and he takes listeners on a ride that is both memorable and unsettling.
